/**
 * VENDORED FROM THE DEEPSPACE SDK — do not expect upstream updates.
 * =================================================================
 *
 * Source: `deepspace` v0.9.2,
 *   `src/server/rooms/__tests__/game-room.test.ts`.
 * Reason: SDK v0.17.0 deleted `GameRoom` and its tests along with it. This
 *   suite is the executable contract for the vendored `./game-room.ts` — the
 *   spectator write-gate is a security property, so it travels with the code.
 *
 * Why this is cheap: the suite never touched the SDK's internals beyond
 *   `GameRoom` itself. `BaseRoom` — the vendored class's only SDK dependency
 *   — is still exported from `deepspace/worker` and its declaration is
 *   byte-identical between 0.9.2 and 0.23.2.
 *
 * Vendoring deltas (the only edits to the 0.9.2 body):
 *   1. `GameRoom`, `MSG`, `ROLES` and the message union now come from the
 *      local `./game-room` instead of SDK-internal paths.
 *   2. `ServerMessage` was narrowed in 0.17.0 (the game arms were deleted), so
 *      the fake room's `broadcasts` / `sent` buffers are typed with the
 *      vendored `GameServerMessage` union instead.
 *   3. `UserAttachment` still comes from `deepspace/worker` — unchanged.
 *
 * Requires `better-sqlite3` as a devDependency (the SDK had it; a consuming
 * app probably does not — see INTEGRATION.md).
 */

/**
 * GameRoom write-role gating tests.
 *
 * Locks in the SDK contract that viewers / anonymous spectators can
 * watch a game but cannot influence it. Mutating game state — sending
 * inputs, toggling ready, starting or ending the game — requires
 * member or admin. Anonymous connections still receive the GAME_STATE
 * broadcast on connect (they're spectators), but they are not added
 * to the players map, so an unauthenticated visitor cannot block
 * auto-start or appear as a player.
 *
 * Before this gate, any anonymous WebSocket could send GAME_END and
 * forcibly stop a running multiplayer game.
